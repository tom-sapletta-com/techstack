[What is Marlin? | Marlin Firmware](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/introduction.html)

> Marlin is an open source [firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware) for the [RepRap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap_project) family of replicating rapid prototypers — popularly known as “3D printers.” It was derived from [Sprinter](https://reprap.org/wiki/List_of_Firmware#Sprinter) and [grbl](https://reprap.org/wiki/Grbl#Grbl), and became a standalone [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) project on August 12, 2011 with its [Github release](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/commit/f850af5c1ca343ed65b94c4b9da5dd1ab4c4a53c). Marlin is licensed under the GPLv3 and is free for all applications.
> 
> From the start Marlin was built by and for [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/) enthusiasts to be a straightforward, reliable, and adaptable printer driver that “just works.” As a testament to its quality, Marlin is used by several respected commercial 3D printers. [LulzBot](https://www.lulzbot.com/), [Průša Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/), [Creality3D](https://creality3d.shop/), [BIQU](https://www.biqu.equipment/), [Geeetech](https://www.geeetech.com/), and [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com/) are just a few of the vendors who ship a variant of Marlin. Marlin is also capable of driving CNC machines and laser engravers.
